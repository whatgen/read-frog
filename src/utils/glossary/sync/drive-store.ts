 * What the cloud had, in three states rather than two.
 *
 * The config sync returns `null` for both "there is no file" and "the file did
 * not parse", and for a merge that PROPAGATES DELETES those mean opposite
 * things. Read as an empty document, a file we failed to parse says every row in
 * the base was deleted remotely — which wipes the glossary on this device and
 * then uploads the wipe. It needs no corruption to happen either: Google removes
 * the whole appDataFolder when the user disconnects the app from their account.
 *
 * So `absent` means upload and delete nothing, ever; `unreadable` means stop.

 * Uploads the merged document.
 *
 * The PATCH underneath is unconditional, so the file's `modifiedTime` is read
 * again immediately before it: another device that uploaded in the meantime
 * would otherwise have its work erased, and — worse — this device would then
 * record those rows in its base as agreed, so its NEXT sync would read them as
 * deletions and remove them everywhere. Re-checking is not free of races, but it
 * closes the window from minutes to milliseconds, and the caller re-merges
 * rather than proceeding.
 *
 * `If-Match` is not used: Drive v3's support for it on this endpoint is not
 * something this codebase has verified.
 *
 * `accessToken` is required, not optional: the caller has verified which account
 * it belongs to, and every request this makes has to go to THAT account. Letting
 * the helpers resolve their own would leave the check the caller just performed
 * binding nothing — another tab can switch accounts in between, and an
 * absent-file plan would then create the file in the new account while the base
 * records the old one as having agreed to it.
 *
 * The `expected === null` branch is re-checked for the same reason, and it is
 * the one the cross-tab lock alone does not cover: whether a file exists is
 * decided in `planGlossarySync`, which runs BEFORE the lock is taken, so two
 * tabs can both plan against an empty Drive and only then serialise. Creating
 * unconditionally there gives the account two glossary files, which is a state
 * `readRemoteGlossary` refuses outright and the UI offers no way out of. Looking
 * again from inside the lock turns that into an ordinary re-merge.
