  Anonymous usage analytics now records a `glossary` feature the moment one of your terms
  actually matches and goes into a translation prompt, alongside the events the other
  features already report. Owning a glossary reports nothing; the terms have to match.

  The event says which feature the terms rode in on — page translation, subtitles, the
  selection toolbar, or input translation — and nothing else. The terms themselves, and
  the text they matched in, never leave the browser. It is throttled by the same
  once-per-day cache as every other feature-usage event, and the analytics opt-out in
  Settings switches it off with the rest.

## 1.47.3

### Patch Changes

- [#2195](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2195) [`38e3b1a`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/38e3b1a330e3c25c8bec8fae7058044004736e12) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - feat(popup): ask for a store review once you have actually been using Read Frog

  A small card now appears at the bottom of the popup offering to open the store's review
  page, and it only shows up after you have successfully used a feature on three separate
  days. Asking on engagement rather than on how long ago you installed means the question
  only reaches people who have something to say, and a translation that failed never
  counts toward it.

  The card floats over the popup instead of sitting in the layout, so it never pushes the
  controls around while you are reaching for them. Closing it, or going through to the
  store, retires it for good — there is no second ask.

  Rating from the More menu now also lands on the right store. Firefox users were being
  sent to the Chrome Web Store, and Chrome and Firefox now open the reviews view directly
  rather than the listing page.

- [#2194](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2194) [`a6384f6`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/a6384f633609973a2161e8f47414331454538779) Thanks [@taiiiyang](https://github.com/taiiiyang)! - fix(subtitles): rank cue length above sentence completeness in AI segmentation

### Patch Changes

- [#2187](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2187) [`788afe3`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/788afe306de99a504e2256f9248620d4b5737871) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - feat(prompts): link the prompt editors to the prompt variable reference

## 1.47.1

### Patch Changes

- [#2182](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2182) [`17c778c`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/17c778c496b44401a4652388c41adf37a14d839d) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - feat(glossary): link the guide from a glossary's own page

  A glossary raises questions the settings page can only answer in a sentence: what
  `*.example.com` covers and what it leaves out, what an empty translation does, why a
  term can be written for one target language, and which providers honour any of it. The
  glossary editor now carries a **How does it work?** link to the Glossary guide on the
  website, beside the glossary's name — where those questions come up, rather than next to
  one control that only answers one of them.

- [#2184](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2184) [`f5541ff`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/f5541ff67b7de8d8a7ec16d65414fe30c8070e08) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(glossary): say that a website pattern can also end in a wildcard

  A glossary's website list explained the leading `*` and nothing else, so the
  trailing one was invisible: a pattern can carry a path, and that path can end in
  `*`. That is the difference between scoping a glossary to a whole novel site and
  scoping it to one book on it — `example.com/novel/12345/*` — and nobody could
  find it from the screen.

  The line now names all three forms in the space the previous two took:
  `example.com` is that address alone, `*.example.com` adds subdomains, and
  `example.com/docs/*` narrows to one part of a site.

## 1.47.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2180](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2180) [`56b189c`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/56b189c6960e29bc988b38195c163b3af9aec73e) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - feat(glossary): sync your glossaries across devices, and carry them in exports

  Your glossaries now sync through Google Drive alongside your settings, in a file
  of their own. They are merged rather than replaced: terms added on two machines
  end up as one list, a term you edited on one and turned off on the other keeps
  both changes, and deleting a term on one device removes it on the others instead
  of having it come back on the next sync.

  Where the two copies genuinely disagree — the same term reworded differently on
  each machine — you are shown the two versions and pick. The first sync on a
  device tells you what is coming and what is going before it touches anything, a
  sync that would remove a large part of your list asks first, and any sync can be
  undone from the toast it leaves behind. Each sync says what it did to this
  device: how many terms were added, updated and removed.

  Signing in with a different Google account tells you what is about to happen
  before it happens: how many glossary rows this device is sending up to the new
  account, and how to keep only that account's glossaries instead.

  Exporting your settings to a file now includes your glossaries, and importing
  such a file brings them back — so moving to a new machine, or taking a copy
  before a reset, no longer leaves the terms you typed behind. Resetting your
  config leaves your glossaries alone, and now says so.

  **Importing a glossary CSV is stricter, and some files that used to work will
  not.** The file must carry the four columns Export writes —
  `source,target,targetLanguage,caseSensitive` — with every cell filled. A term's
  case rule and target language are part of what identifies it, so a file that
  leaves them out cannot say which rows it is describing; the import screen used
  to guess with a checkbox and a language picker, which meant one file could land
  two different ways. Those two controls are gone. Two-column files from other
  tools, exports from before those columns existed, and a bare term on a line of
  its own are refused now, with a message naming the columns. Export a glossary to
  see the shape, or add the header and the two columns to an existing file.

  The sidebar groups Page Translation, Video Subtitles and Input Translation under
  one Translation entry, and Advanced moves to the bottom.

- [#2171](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2171) [`0f537ad`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/0f537ad0ec2ec83edf23ad49b357c13250fe567a) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - feat(glossary): add user-defined glossaries

  Define a term once and every AI translation uses your wording. Leave a term's translation empty to keep it
  in the original language, which is usually what names and usernames need. Only the terms that actually
  appear in a paragraph are sent to the model, so a large glossary costs nothing on pages that do not use it.

  Terms live in glossaries, and each glossary can be limited to the websites you want it on — a set of game
  terms on one wiki, work vocabulary on your company's docs, nothing anywhere else. A glossary with no
  website listed applies everywhere. Where two glossaries give the same term different wording, the one
  lower in the list wins.

  Each term is written for one target language, chosen next to the term itself and defaulting to whatever
  you currently translate into, so the same word can have a Chinese wording and a Japanese one side by side
  and only the one that applies is ever sent.

  Turn an individual term or a whole glossary off without deleting it, import and export each list as CSV
  (now with a `targetLanguage` column; two-column files still import), or empty it in one go. Importing with
  Replace asks for confirmation first, because it clears the glossary in every target language, not just the
  one you picked. Find it under Advanced → Glossary in the extension settings.

### Patch Changes

- [#2181](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2181) [`3e29045`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/3e29045702dcb2698ea8e5a64cead1e705461735) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - feat(glossary): let a term apply to every target language

  A term with no translation means "leave this word alone", which is true whatever you are
  translating into — but until now it had to be filed under one language, so it quietly
  stopped working the moment you switched target language. Terms can now be set to **All
  languages**, and that is what a term with an empty translation is set to by default.

  Where both exist, a wording written for the language you are translating into wins over
  the all-languages one, so a term can keep its original form everywhere except where you
  have given it a rendering. Exports carry the setting and imports read it back.

  The website list on a glossary now explains the difference between `*.example.com`, which
  covers a site and its subdomains, and `example.com`, which matches only that exact address.

- [#2181](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2181) [`3e29045`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/3e29045702dcb2698ea8e5a64cead1e705461735) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - feat(glossary): edit a term without deleting and re-adding it

  Every part of a term can now be changed in place. The pencil on a row turns it into
  fields: the term itself, its translation, the target language it is written for, and
  whether it matches case — the `Aa` button on the term field. Enter or the tick saves,
  Escape or the cross throws the edit away. Fixing a typo no longer means deleting the row
  and typing the whole thing again, which also lost the term's on/off state.

  Editing a term keeps it exactly where it was in the list. The list is ordered by when
  each term was last changed, so without this the row you had just finished editing would
  jump to the end — off the page entirely on a list longer than one.

- [#2175](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2175) [`1cf3e5f`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/1cf3e5fa48741dc38f8aab7c08853bded426214c) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - fix(glossary): correct term matching, CSV round-tripping, and the term counter

  A term is no longer skipped when a longer term starts at the same place and does not
  apply there. `Chort` was lost in "landed at Chort bayonet" because `Chort Bay` matched
  first and then failed at its edge — while the same term still worked in other sentences,
  which made it hard to notice.

  Exported CSVs now carry each term's case-sensitivity setting and open correctly in Excel,
  so exporting and re-importing a glossary lands back on the rows it came from instead of
  adding a second copy of every case-sensitive term. Files saved by Excel in a regional
  encoding are read properly rather than imported as garbled text, and a quoted value
  spanning two lines no longer turns into a stray "keep the original" rule.

  The term count under a glossary now describes that glossary, and the 20,000-term limit —
  which counts every glossary together — is shown with the glossary library, where it
  applies. Running out of room says so in those terms instead of calling one glossary full.

- [#2178](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2178) [`02318d0`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/02318d0aa4d8290684aa204108fba3f68c7e3a1e) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(i18n): give the note suggestion feature one Chinese name

  In Chinese the feature was 猜你想存 on the card and in the Built-in AI lists, but
  保存建议 (儲存建議 in zh-TW) in the settings toggle, the command palette, and the
  card's own on/off switch — so searching the settings for the name you saw on the page
  turned up nothing ([#2176](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/issues/2176)). All of them now read 猜你想存.

- [#2171](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2171) [`0f537ad`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/0f537ad0ec2ec83edf23ad49b357c13250fe567a) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - chore(firefox): raise the minimum supported Firefox to 140

  The manifest previously declared Firefox 112 as the floor, a value set when Firefox
  first shipped MV3 and never revisited. The extension already calls `Intl.Segmenter`
  on the page-translation path (`filter-small-paragraph.ts`), which requires Firefox
  125, so the declared floor was not one the code could keep. Firefox 140 is a
  currently supported ESR.

- [#2177](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2177) [`a250e6c`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/a250e6c41f5460b6a8b28bbe6004b5c254307370) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(translation): distinguish preserved names and code from foreign-language prose when skipping already-translated paragraphs

  Bilingual page translation flattened every paragraph to plain text, so
  rendered formulas (native MathML on arXiv, KaTeX, MathJax, Wikipedia math)
  vanished from the translated line or leaked as glyph soup, and no site rule
  could bring them back. Formula elements are now "inline atoms": each is sent
  to the provider as a `{{n}}` placeholder and a sanitized clone of the
  original element is put back at the placeholder's translated position. A new
  `atomSelectors` site-rule family (seeded for the common renderers) decides
  what counts as an atom; paragraphs without atoms are unchanged.

  The selection toolbar's always-mounted full-viewport `fixed inset-0` layer
  made Chrome claim horizontal touch pans on pages using `touch-action:
manipulation`, firing `pointercancel` and breaking touch drag gestures
  (e.g. carousels). Collapse the overlay root to 0x0 while the toolbar is

  The reason "Translation only" is greyed out never reached the screen: a disabled
  select row is `pointer-events-none`, so the browser never rendered its native
  `title`. Show it in a real tooltip instead, and build the sentence from whichever
  provider blocks the mode, so the popup toggle, the mode shortcut and the options
  select all stay correct as that list changes.

  Virtualized pages (X articles and timelines, and any React list that unmounts off-screen rows) destroy paragraph nodes on scroll and recreate brand-new ones on the way back, so scrolling down and back up re-ran the whole translation pipeline for text the tab had already translated — every paragraph flashed its original text and a spinner while a background round trip re-fetched the same cached translation. Page-translation results are now also remembered in an in-tab memory tier keyed by the same request hash as the background cache, so remounted regions recover their translations without the round trip or the visible churn.

  When the viewer had YouTube's own CC off, the player reported no selected track and the fetcher fell back to whichever caption track happened to be listed first — so a video whose first track is not the viewer's usual language had to be corrected by hand every time. The player response already names the track YouTube itself would play (`defaultCaptionTrackIndex`), so read that instead. A live selection in the player still wins, and responses that omit the field fall back to enabling CC and following the player's choice.

  A provider's description is resolved from the interface language when the provider is created, which a migration cannot do — so Jalapeno Cloud reached existing users in v098 with an empty description box while fresh installs saw its blurb. v099 fills in the English description for any API provider that has none.

- [#2125](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2125) [`d0fc8e5`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/d0fc8e57faf2d3954626312fc64fbdcb8f11629c) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - fix(translation): apply the removal of custom CSS without needing a reload

  Switching translated text back to a preset style, or emptying the custom CSS box, only changed the marker on the node — the stylesheet itself stayed applied until the page was reloaded. Anything the preset did not set kept the old styling, so clearing a `color` rule under the border preset, for instance, left the text its old colour. The stylesheet is now withdrawn along with the marker.

  The custom CSS written for translated text was injected into the options page's own document to render the preview, so it styled the settings UI as well. A rule as ordinary as `* { display: none }` left the options page blank on every load — editor and sidebar included — with the CSS saved in config and no way back through the UI.

  The preview now renders inside a same-origin frame, so the CSS reaches the sample text and nothing else. Because a frame is a document, everything the CSS could do on a real page it still does here — `:root` variables, `body` selectors, `@font-face` and `@property` all behave as they will in the wild, and the sample now inherits an ordinary page's 16px rather than the settings page's 14px.

  The "How to configure?" link in the subtitle custom CSS editor opened the page-translation
  stylesheet guide, which documents a different selector contract: `[data-read-frog-custom-translation-style]`
  and the translated-content wrapper, none of which exist inside the subtitles shadow root. It now
  opens `/docs/subtitle-custom-css`, which covers the three class hooks the subtitle overlay
  actually exposes, the preset templates, and the two places the style controls win over custom CSS.

  The subtitle style page could only set fonts, sizes, weights and colours, so effects like blurring the translation while training your listening had nowhere to live. A custom CSS row at the bottom of that page now opens an editor with the same live preview above it, plus a preset dropdown carrying three ready-made templates — blur translation, dashed translation, and dim original — that append into the editor so they can be stacked.

  The picked font, size, weight and colour now reach the subtitle lines as CSS variables rather than inline styles, so custom CSS can override them without `!important`.

  The preview renders in a shadow root, the same way the real overlay does, so the CSS being previewed reaches the preview and nothing else on the settings page.

  Tall containers are split into their descendant paragraphs so viewport-lazy translation still applies ([#1881](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/issues/1881)). That split silently drops any text the container holds directly, which is harmless on a nested `<article>` but catastrophic on `<br>`-delimited article bodies, where the bare text _is_ the article — a Blogger post kept 8% of its text and paulgraham.com/greatwork.html kept 1.1%, while the incidental inline `<i>` got its own translation inserted mid-sentence.

  - Refuse the split when the container owns prose of its own and has a block-level child, so the translate path re-segments it into per-line runs instead
  - Keep splitting when the container owns no prose (unchanged for docs.docker.com), when its own text carries no letters (separators, dates), when it has no block child to re-segment on, when it is `<body>`, or when the split already yields more units than the gating cap
  - Apply the same guard on the translate side's giant fallback, so both paths make one decision

  Pages served as `text/plain` reach the browser as a single generated `<pre>` holding the whole file, which the walker skipped entirely — nifty.org story pages translated as nothing at all. Such a `<pre>` is now translated, while an authored `<pre>` in an HTML document still keeps its code and logs untouched.

  Translation-only mode also gains the per-paragraph granularity bilingual mode has had, so a long page goes out one blank-line paragraph at a time instead of as one oversized request: paragraphs appear as they arrive, and a failed one costs only itself.

### Minor Changes

- [#2072](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/2072) [`1590dfd`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/1590dfd17e6431abce4494b038876642a8cbfe85) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - feat(subtitles): AI subtitles leave beta — Pro/Ultra minute quota with per-pool usage

  AI subtitle transcription is out of beta: the "(Beta)" label, the beta pre-flight, and the Tally application form are gone. Requesting subtitles now needs a Pro or Ultra subscription — a free account gets an upgrade prompt instead of an application link, a lapsed payment is pointed at billing, and an unsupported video length gets its own message. The create request now reports the player's video duration so the server can check the quota before spending transcription time.

  Every one of those walls now answers in place with a button you choose to press — "Log in", "Upgrade", "Update payment" — instead of a browser tab opening on its own mid-video. The plan and quota are checked before the subtitles flow starts, so a click that gets turned away leaves the subtitles you were already watching untouched, and running out of minutes now says when they come back. The "Loading AI subtitles" pill no longer stays pinned to the player after a refusal, and a refusal that arrives while the transcript is being fetched is translated instead of showing the server's raw English.

  The options page quota section shows one usage bar per quota pool: the monthly subscription quota with its reset date, and — for launch-window subscribers — the one-time launch gift with its expiry date. Against an older server the section falls back to the single-bar totals it showed before.

  Built-in AI now covers video subtitles (translation, the video summary, and AI segmentation), input-box translation, language detection, and page translation's AI summary — everything that previously needed your own API key. Like page translation, these run on the Ultra plan; provider dropdowns mark and gray out what your account cannot run, and the Ultra badge opens the pricing page.

  Language detection in particular could never offer Built-in AI before: its provider picker only listed providers stored in your own configuration, and the built-in ones are not stored there. Fixing that makes LLM detection mode available whenever an account can actually run it, and deleting your last API provider no longer silently drops language detection back to basic — if nothing left could run a feature, the deletion is refused and names the feature instead.

  Built-in AI now comes in two tiers. Ultra members can run page translation on the advanced model, everyone else keeps Custom AI Actions on the standard one.

  The hosted model tier is now `advance` rather than `ultra`, and the advanced built-in provider's id is `read-frog-advance-ai` rather than `read-frog-ultra-ai`. Model names and plan names are now separate vocabularies: which plan unlocks which tier is server-side policy, so a future plan can be sold with any tier without renaming anything here. The provider's display name is unchanged ("Advanced Built-in AI"), and the "Ultra" badge, its tooltip, and the "Ultra plan required" message all still say Ultra on purpose — they name the plan you have to buy, not the model you run on.

  Config schema v097 rewrites the provider id everywhere it is persisted, so an existing selection of the advanced provider is preserved.

  Built-in AI is in every feature's provider list whether or not your plan funds
  it, and several places treated "a provider exists" as "a provider works". The
  result was a set of failures with no symptom: video subtitles came back
  untranslated and were recorded as done, input translation showed a spinner and
  nothing else, and the Language detection card stayed green over a code path that
  never ran once. Each of those now says which limit it hit, while still degrading
  rather than breaking the page.

  The same confusion drove the settings surfaces. Provider dropdowns, the
  Language detection and AI-context cards, the popup's provider avatars and the
  Built-in AI editor now share one rule for whether an option can actually run —
  read from the plan and sign-in state alone, so an exhausted quota or a passing
  outage no longer greys out an option you own, and a plan wall no longer reads as
  healthy. Deleting a provider is refused when it would leave a feature with
  nothing that can run it, naming the feature rather than saying "at least one LLM
  provider is required".

  Skip-language detection no longer uses an LLM. It runs once per paragraph, so a
  long article meant hundreds of billed calls to avoid the occasional redundant
  translation; franc answers the same question for free. Language detection mode
  still governs the once-per-page source detection, where a wrong answer would
  affect every paragraph.

  Also: the hosted availability check is fetched once and shared instead of per
  paragraph, per cue batch and per selection; original subtitles now appear
  without waiting on it; the page-context warm-up covers Built-in AI, so the first
  paragraph no longer pays for it; a video summary is no longer requested from a
  provider that has no model to prompt; and hosted subtitle and input-translation
  runs are no longer reported as provider "unknown" in usage analytics.

  The Ultra badge that marks plan-gated Built-in AI options is now clickable and opens the pricing page, so an upgrade is one click away from the place the limit is discovered. Clicking it never selects the provider it sits on or toggles the assignment switch it sits beside, and its tooltip now says so.

  The old token endpoint (edge.microsoft.com/translate/auth) was removed upstream, which broke Microsoft translation entirely. The replacement endpoint needs no auth but has no markup-preserving mode, so translation-only page mode no longer offers Microsoft: pickers hide it while translation-only is active, mode controls explain why it cannot be entered, and existing configs pairing them are migrated to Google Translate (or bilingual mode as a fallback). Microsoft translation error handling now also carries retry metadata, and the restored free-api tests cover the live endpoint again.

  `command`, `command-nightly`, `command-light`, `command-light-nightly`, `command-r`, `command-r-03-2024`, `command-r-plus` and `command-r-plus-04-2024` are gone from the model picker, and `command-r-plus-08-2024` joins the `command-a-*` line. A v090 → v091 migration moves any saved Cohere provider off a retired id: the `command-r*` families keep their generation and the original `command`/`command-light` line lands on `command-a-03-2025`. That includes a retired id sitting in the custom-model field, which passes validation and would otherwise keep calling a dead endpoint with no visible error. New Cohere providers now default to `command-a-translate-08-2025`.

  Replaces the dead `linkedinFeed` rule with a working `linkedin` one. Post and comment bodies no longer get cut off (their collapse container is `max-height:100px`, which only an `!important` override beats), actor headlines wrap instead of ellipsizing, and the post actor block stops collapsing into one oversized paragraph — its wrapper anchor is `display:inline` where the comment equivalent is `block`, so it is forced to a block node. Page chrome (nav, footer, sidebar, ads), author names and the "Visit my website" link are excluded from translation.

Also pins the pnpm-managed Node runtime to `^26.5.1` and aligns the CI `node-version` with it, so the declared version matches the one that actually runs the build and tests.

  Fixes two independent bugs that each caused translations to disappear and
  reappear around SPA route changes:

  1. The same-origin URL-change handler tore down every translation wrapper and
     rebuilt the session. Both Navigation API events fire synchronously inside
     `pushState` — before the router swaps the DOM — so the teardown always hit
     the still-visible previous page. The handler now keeps the session and
     wrappers mounted (the live MutationObserver walks the new route's DOM) and
     only swaps path-scoped site CSS, in place.

  2. URL-change detection listened to the Navigation API `navigate` event, which
     also fires for cross-document navigations and pre-commit (cancellable)
     ones — running a full translation restart on pages about to unload and
     desyncing the tracked URL on cancelled navigations. Detection now uses
     `currententrychange`, which only fires for committed same-document changes.

  Two Firefox-only issues in the extension's shared request path blocked AI
  subtitle requests and Notebase loading:

  - `normalizeHeaders` spread `Headers.entries()`, whose iterator is not iterable
    across the Firefox extension realm ("headersInit.entries() is not iterable").
    Collect entries with `Headers.forEach` instead.
  - The proxy-fetch dropped the POST body because `Request.body` is null for
    some extension requests on Firefox. Read the body with `request.text()`
    directly so the payload is forwarded instead of producing 400 "expected
    object, received undefined" responses.

## 1.42.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1897](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1897) [`04b04ac`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/04b04acadae24b0f4f30c69c756d1b8cbcd1c523) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - feat(translation): add a four-variant new-user default prompt experiment

- [#1900](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1900) [`8dfacda`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/8dfacdac66c742e40c79e078fdfe3f73145f48d2) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(translate): stop a single 429 from failing the whole page and make rate limiting actually hold

  - A 429 now pauses the queue (honoring `Retry-After`) and retries in place instead of instantly rejecting every pending paragraph — one transient rate limit no longer paints hundreds of errors or kills the session
  - Batches now keep filling up to the configured size while the rate limiter has no free slot, so low request rates send few full batches instead of many tiny ones
  - Queue config is applied reliably: handlers register synchronously at SW startup, `storage.watch` replaces droppable per-field messages, and capacity edits no longer grant a free burst
  - Batch request timeouts scale with batch size; summary generation is abortable and no longer performs hidden ai-sdk retries

### Patch Changes

- [#1906](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1906) [`5ded459`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/5ded4592cb263d27ad1221d763f10af21f64af6f) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(selection): keep shadow-root popups anchored to the viewport

## 1.41.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1887](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1887) [`b14bd0a`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/b14bd0a612909e8cc70932b97b5123a80467faca) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(custom-actions): add a link to open the connected notebase

- [#1884](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1884) [`18e8901`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/18e8901ff97cc9ef682bbe387014018fd768af8b) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - fix(translate): stop long-page freezes and drain cancelled translation queues ([#1881](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/issues/1881))

  - Split giant observed paragraphs (e.g. a flat 185k-px article labeled as one paragraph) into their descendant paragraphs so viewport-lazy translation actually applies instead of enqueueing the whole page at once
  - Cap concurrent spinner animations and cancel them via stored handles — thousands of live WAAPI animations were driving continuous full-page style recalcs
  - Cancel a page-translation session's queued/in-flight background requests on toggle-off, tab close, or restart (scoped per tab + session, dedup-shared requests are refcounted)
  - Time-slice the initial DOM labeling walk and pace subtree translation so the main thread stays responsive on huge pages

- [#1889](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1889) [`5b03d64`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/5b03d6476dbe12f56e5651627f4dc869a4ef81cf) Thanks [@ananaBMaster](https://github.com/ananaBMaster)! - feat(toast): migrate notifications to Base UI and add contextual anchored feedback

## 1.40.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1844](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1844) [`29f18a0`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/29f18a0d188a5844653c53fcf7cd007f5f585003) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(site-rules): keep PR/discussion/commit reference links in GitHub markdown translations

  Modern GitHub markup renders references like `[#1837](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/issues/1837)` as a bare `a[data-hovercard-type='pull_request']` with no `.issue-link` class, so the broad `a[data-hovercard-type]` exclude dropped them from the translation source (e.g. release notes lost every PR number). Preserve `pull_request`, `discussion`, and `commit` hovercard links inside `.markdown-body` as source text so they survive translation verbatim.

- [#1845](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1845) [`05134f5`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/05134f5c06633200e9f86c95e75517de6b836fb7) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - feat(ui): bundle Onest Variable (~62 KB) and use it for the extension's Latin UI text, matching the web app. Imported only in the extension's own pages (popup / options / side panel / translation hub), so no webfont is injected into content scripts on host pages. Also adds an unlayered `body { font-family: var(--rf-font-sans) }` override — Chromium injects `body { font-family: system-ui, … }` into every extension page (extension_fonts.css), which otherwise intercepts the inherited font stack so neither Onest nor the CJK fallbacks would ever apply

- [#1841](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1841) [`0263b50`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/0263b50ff00586a6630a15aa8e9bf9dd2cdc049e) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(translate): store translationOnly original-content snapshots in a WeakMap so elements removed by the site (SPA re-renders, infinite scroll) no longer retain detached DOM nodes and their HTML strings for the page's lifetime

- [#1840](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1840) [`a150c78`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/a150c7807bc9f13f919aebd57a8186187e5f9898) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(translate): remove orphan splitText tails when the host rewrites or replaces the source Text node, so failed split restores no longer duplicate stale tail text on pre-wrap sites

- [#1839](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1839) [`0a7eab2`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/0a7eab2e064977daa2e4d4be86d0d1068a13f3ff) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - fix(translate): cancel timed-out queue attempts with an AbortSignal before retrying and coalesce concurrent identical batch requests by cache hash, so provider slowdowns no longer stack duplicate in-flight requests

- [#1845](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/pull/1845) [`05134f5`](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog/commit/05134f5c06633200e9f86c95e75517de6b836fb7) Thanks [@mengxi-ream](https://github.com/mengxi-ream)! - feat(ui): add 思源黑体 (Source Han Sans / Noto Sans CJK) to the extension UI font fallback stack, after system-ui and before the generic sans-serif, so Chinese UI text resolves to it by name on platforms where it is the default (Android / ChromeOS / Linux) while macOS/Windows keep their lang-correct native PingFang / 微软雅黑
